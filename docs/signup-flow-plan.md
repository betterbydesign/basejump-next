## Overview Section
- Issue: SIMPL-20 (30/255)
- Flow Name: Agency Signup Process
- Flow Purpose: Enable agencies to sign up and start using the system
- Entry Point(s): Marketing site CTA, Direct signup URL

## User Story Mapping
### Core Story
"As a new agency I want to a step-by-step signup process so that I can start using the system without confusion"

### Authentication Strategy
We've opted for a passwordless authentication system using:
1. Email + OTP verification
   - 6-digit code
   - 5-minute expiration
   - Rate-limited attempts
2. Google OAuth alternative
   - Faster onboarding
   - Managed security
   - Institutional trust

Benefits:
- Enhanced security (no password storage)
- Improved UX (no password management)
- Better HIPAA compliance
- Reduced attack surface
- Simpler user onboarding

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage Plan
